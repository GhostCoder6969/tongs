# Contributing to tongs

Thanks for your interest in tongs! Bug reports, fixes, docs improvements, and
new ideas are all welcome, and you do not need to know the whole codebase to
help.

## Finding something to work on

- Issues labelled
  [good first issue](https://github.com/andre-motta/tongs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
  are small and self-contained, and most say which file to open and which test
  to run.
- Issues in the current
  [milestones](https://github.com/andre-motta/tongs/milestones) are what we plan
  to ship next.
- Found a bug? [Open an issue](https://github.com/andre-motta/tongs/issues/new/choose).
- For a larger change or a new feature, open an issue first so we can agree on
  the approach before you spend time on it.

Leave a comment on an issue if you want to pick it up or have a question. Asking
is always fine.

## Setting up

You need Python 3.12 or newer. From the root of your clone:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,mcp]" ruff
```

With `uv`, use `uv venv --python 3.12` and `uv pip install` instead. Tests mock
all GitHub and GitLab traffic, so you do not need a forge account or token to
run them.

Working on the desktop app also needs Node.js 22.12 or newer:

```bash
npm ci --prefix desktop
```

## Making a change

1. Create a branch and make your change.
2. Run the tests closest to what you changed, for example
   `pytest tests/test_widgets/test_pipeline_panel.py -q`.
3. Before opening the pull request, run:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ruff check src/ tests/
   ruff format --check src/ tests/
   ```

   Run `ruff format <file>` to fix formatting.
4. Open a pull request and fill in the short template. CI runs the full suite on
   Python 3.12 and 3.13 and the desktop tests. A maintainer will review it.

Small, focused pull requests are easier to review and land faster than large
ones.

### Desktop changes

Build the desktop app and run its tests:

```bash
npm run build --prefix desktop
TONGS_TEST_PYTHON="$(command -v python)" npm test --prefix desktop
```

The full desktop suite can use a lot of memory. The
[testing guide](.agents/testing/README.md#bounded-local-node-procedure) shows
how to run a single test file under a memory limit, which is usually all you
need while developing. In renderer tests, assert on text, attributes, and
counts rather than on DOM nodes: a failing assertion on a DOM node can use more
than a gigabyte of memory while it formats the error.

### Documentation changes

Docs live in `docs/` and are published to [tongs.tools](https://www.tongs.tools).
No pull request check builds the site, so build it locally:

```bash
mkdocs build --strict
```

## Code style

- Put `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of every module.
- Type every parameter and return value.
- Use module-level imports, unless a local import is needed to avoid a circular
  dependency.
- Use frozen dataclasses for immutable data and regular dataclasses for mutable
  state.
- Comments explain why, not what.
- Avoid em dashes in prose and commit messages.

## Commits

Write a short title, a blank line, and a one-line description:

```text
Fix log search input hidden behind status bar

Dock the search input and status line in one container.
```

Sign off your commits with `git commit -s`. This adds a `Signed-off-by` line
certifying the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/),
which is required for every commit.

If an AI assistant wrote part of a commit, credit it with a
`Co-Authored-By:` trailer naming the actual tool and model.

## Where things are

```text
src/tongs/
  services/        # Shared application logic used by both frontends
  forges/          # GitHub and GitLab clients, authentication, HTTP
  scanner/         # Finds local repositories and parses their remotes
  cache/           # SQLite response cache
  diff/, state/    # Diff models and review drafts
  views/, widgets/ # Terminal UI (Textual) screens and widgets
  desktop/         # Python side of the desktop app, installer
  plugins/         # Plugin registries
  mcp/             # Optional MCP server
desktop/src/       # Desktop app (Electron main process and React UI)
tests/             # Mirrors the source layout
```

Both frontends talk to forges only through `ApplicationSession` in
`src/tongs/services/session.py`. The terminal UI calls it directly, and the
desktop app reaches it through a Python helper process (the "sidecar").

Each subsystem has a short guide under [`.agents/`](.agents/) (for example
[TUI](.agents/tui/README.md), [forges](.agents/forges/README.md), and
[testing](.agents/testing/README.md)). These guides are written for both people
and coding assistants. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) gives the overview.

### Adding a forge backend

1. Implement `ForgeClient` in `src/tongs/forges/your_forge.py`, returning the
   shared models from `src/tongs/forges/models.py`.
2. Update remote detection in `src/tongs/scanner/remote.py` and client creation
   in `src/tongs/forges/registry.py`.
3. Add a credential source to `src/tongs/forges/auth.py`.
4. Add mocked tests under `tests/test_forges/` and `tests/services/`.

### Writing a plugin

Terminal plugins use the `tongs.plugins` entry point and desktop plugins use
`tongs.desktop_plugins`. See the [plugin guide](docs/guides/plugins.md), the
[desktop provider guide](docs/plugins/provider.md), and the
[desktop example](examples/desktop-plugin/README.md).

## Maintainers

CI workflows, release steps, packaging checks, and what to do when a CI job
fails are covered in the [CI and release guide](.agents/ci/README.md).

## Security

Do not report vulnerabilities in a public issue. Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
