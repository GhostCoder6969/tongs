The Diff tab is where you read a review and comment on it. Press ++2++ from
any review to open it.

## Layout

The Diff tab has two panes:

- **File tree** on the left. It lists every changed file with a status letter
  (`M` modified, `A` added, `D` deleted, `R` renamed), its `+` and `-` line
  counts, and how many of its comment threads are open or resolved.
- **Diff** on the right. It shows the selected file with syntax highlighting,
  line numbers and gutter markers.

## Unified and split view

Press ++v++ to switch between unified and split view. Split view shows the old
and new versions side by side with their lines aligned. Press ++h++ to move
focus to the old side and ++l++ to move it to the new side.

When the terminal is too narrow for split view, tongs uses unified view and
tells you: "Split view selected; using unified at this width".

## Moving around

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| ++j++ / ++k++ | Move the cursor down or up one line |
| ++n++ / ++shift+n++ | Next or previous file, wrapping at either end |
| ++close-bracket++ / ++open-bracket++ | Next or previous comment thread |

Click a file in the tree to jump straight to it.

## Selecting lines

Select a range of lines to comment on several lines at once or to suggest a
replacement.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| ++shift+j++ | Extend the selection down |
| ++shift+k++ | Extend the selection up |
| ++ctrl++ + click | Extend the selection to the clicked line |
| ++escape++ | Clear the selection |

## Reading the diff

- **Syntax highlighting.** tongs picks a highlighter from the file name, using
  Pygments.
- **Word-level changes.** In the unified view, the words that changed inside a
  changed line are bold and underlined, so a small edit in a long line stands out.
- **Folded context.** Long unchanged stretches between changes collapse into a
  marker such as `... 42 unchanged lines ...`.
- **Markdown preview.** On a Markdown file, press ++m++ to switch between the
  diff and the rendered file.
- **Files without a diff.** When the forge truncates a large diff or does not
  expose it, the file stays in the tree with its line counts and the pane says
  why. Binary files, empty files, mode changes and pure renames get a short
  label instead of a diff. Press ++o++ to open the review in your browser.

## Comment threads in the diff

Existing threads show as gutter markers next to their lines. Press ++d++ on a
marked line to expand or collapse its thread. On a line with a thread, press
++r++ to reply and ++shift+r++ to resolve or reopen it. tongs asks you to press
++shift+r++ a second time to confirm.

### Adding a comment

1. Move to the line, or select the lines, you want to comment on.
2. Press ++c++ to open the comment editor at the bottom of the screen.
3. Write your comment.
4. Press ++ctrl+s++ to submit, or ++escape++ to cancel. If the editor has text,
   press ++escape++ twice to discard it.

### Suggesting changes

1. Select the lines you want to replace. Suggestions work on the new side of
   the diff only.
2. Press ++f3++. tongs opens your editor with the selected code filled in.
3. Edit the code into the replacement you suggest.
4. Save and close the editor.
5. tongs posts the suggestion in the forge's own syntax: `` ```suggestion ``
   on GitHub and `` ```suggestion:-0+N `` on GitLab.

If you close the editor without changing the code, tongs cancels the
suggestion.

### External editor

Press ++f2++ in the comment editor to continue the comment in an external
editor. tongs moves the text to the editor and back when you save and close
it.

++f2++ and ++f3++ use `$VISUAL`, then `$EDITOR`, then the first of `nvim`,
`vim`, `vi` and `nano` found on your `PATH`. ++f2++ is not available on
Windows.

:::tip[Review drafts]
While a review draft is open (++ctrl+g++), ++c++, ++r++ and ++f3++ add to the
draft instead of posting right away. You submit the whole draft once. See
[Review drafts](/guides/review-drafts/).
